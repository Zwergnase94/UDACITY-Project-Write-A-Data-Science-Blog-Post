## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:


1. When do people work in the HomeOffice?
2. Is there a connection between salary and days spent in the home office?
3. Do you start later if you work more at home?

## File Descriptions<a name="filedescriptions"></a>
Stack Overflow Analyse UDACITY Project.ipynb Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations

survey_results_public.csv Original dataset in csv format
survey_results_schema.csv Original dataset schema in csv format

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@manuel.neumann94/how-is-mobile-working-developing-fbb66b08f424).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
